## Evaluation Plan

### Evalutation Techniques ###
* Techniques: 
    * Observation Technique(**Post-task Walkthroughs**): The Post-Task Walkthrough would be the most appropriate observation technique that is suited for our particular game. Due to the fast paced gameplay within our game that results from the difficulty of the game the other techniques would not be suitable to utilize. Using Post-task walkthrough ensures that we avoid any unecessary interruptions to the participants which is necessary as we want the participant to remain immersed. Additionally other methods for observation such as Think Aloud and Cooperative evaluation would simply not work with our game as due to the pacing it would be quite challenging for a participant to take time to explain their thinking or even answer questions that we pose to them(Samundeeshwaran, 2022). It also avoids the possible awkwardness that a participant may feel by having to narrate their thoughts which could remove them from the experience the game is attempting to create

    * Querying Technique(**Questionnaires**): Providing fixed questions to users is a more suitable approach for our querying technique as it is less time consuming compared to an interview. Additionally it allows us to gather a large amount of participant easily by simply sharing a link to the questionnaire which provides us with a varying set of perspectives that can prove useful when evaluating our game(Samundeeshwaran, 2022). However depending on the questions that we administer as part of our Questionnaires we run the potenital risk of receiving very surface level answers from our participants. As such we will ensure that we mainly utilize open-ended questions to allow pariticpants to answer in depth but also utilize scalar or multi choice questions to accquire approprirate qualitative data 

* Tasks: The primary task that we will ask our participants to perform will be to play through the first level of our game Lunala and the Celestial Tower. This is an ideal task to make participants perform as it provide them with the tutorial to the game and educates them on the primary mechanics that are required. By asking them to play the first level of the game through to completion they are able to experience the majority of the elements of the game such as the abilities, upgrade and enemies. The primary reason that we have one task instead of multiple smaller tasks is that the primary appeal of our game is the combat and so with the task of simply attempting to beat the first level we accquire valuable feedback on the core elements of the game such as difficulty and enemy-player interaction. Additionally it is useful when we attempt to utilize the Post-task walkthrough method for observation as we avoid the risk of the pariticpant forgetting critical information as their focus is on one task. 



### Participants ###

* Recruiting Participants: The primary plan to recruit participants is to gather from the friends and family members of the team. This is an ideal plan as these participants are easily accessible and easy to contact. It is also easy to use either the observation or querying technique on them due to them being readily available. However, simply gathering participants who have close relations with members of the team may have risks as they may be less inclined to provide critical feedback and their feedback may be biased. As such an additional plan to recruit participants is to utilize channels such as the University of Melbourne Reddit which will allow us to gather a wide range of participants who are likely to be more critical of the game. 

* Qualifying Criteria: To ensure that the participants that we are recruiting fall within our target audience we will utilize a questionnaire that allows us to determine the background of the participants. As we stated within the GDD, our target audience is individuals over the age of 12 and those who enjoy games whose selling point is the challenge and fast-paced gameplay. It is crucial that we identify participants that fall within our target audience as their feedback would carry more weight and our goal is to make the game engaging for them. Within the questionnaire, it is likely that we will have questions to identify their background and others to determine what kind of games they typically play or the aspects of games they find enjoyable.

### Data Collection ### 

* Collecting Data: Within our evaluation, we will aim to collect a mix of qualitative data and quantitative data to provide ourselves with a more well-rounded set of feedback that we can utilize to make appropriate changes 
    * Qualitative Data: Collecting qualitative data is important as it provides us with more detailed insight into the issues of our games while also complementing the qualitative data we collect. It is also useful to well capture participant's feedback and perspectives in a detailed manner.  There is a variety of qualitative data we can collect utilizing open-ended questions such as: 
        * What was your first impression of the game? 
        * What aspects of the game did you find particularly frustrating? 
        * What aspects of the game did you find satisfying? 
        * What was your strategy for winning? 
        * How did you find the controls? 
        * What elements of the game appealed to you? 
    * Quantitative Data: Collecting quantitative data allows us to explore and determine if there are any patterns or trends that are recurring within our evaluations. It is essential to provide us with actionable data that allows us to make informed decisions regarding changes that need to be made within the game. Examples of possible quantitative data can be:
        * Level of Difficulty on a scale from 1 to 10
        * Time survived 
        * Number of Upgrades Acquired 
        * Number of players that would play again
        * Which of the 3 abilities did you use the most? Did you not use abilities at all? 

* Data Collection Methods: In order to collect the data we will use observational notes, directed questions to the participants, a questionnaire, and gameplay recording. These methods in combination will allow us to collect a range of qualitative and observational data.

* Data Collection Tools: 
    * Nvidia Game Capture: We will use Nvidia Game Capture to record the gameplay of participants when utilizing Post talk walkthroughs
    * Google Forms: We will Google Forms to create the questionnaires required for the game evaluation
    * Pen and paper: Pen and paper will be a useful tool to make quick observation notes regarding the behavior of participants who are being evaluated via our observation techniques

### Data Analysis ###

* Analysis Methods: 
    * Quantitative Data: In order to analyze the quantitative data we can develop a hypothesis by taking an initial look at the results from the evaluation. We can then move on to creating graphs that help visualize the results of the evaluation and easily identify any trends. This will help provide us with a factual basis for any changes that we deem necessary to make. 
    * Qualitative Data: In order to analyze the qualitative data we collect the responses from each participant and compare them in order to identify common trends that are present in each individual's response. We can use these findings to develop grounded theories or claims that are supported by evidence in order to make decisions regarding necessary changes. It is important for this analysis that we have multiple individuals attempt to interpret the responses provided by the participants as it ensures that there is a clear consensus regarding the interpretation of the results. 

* Metrics: There are some important metrics that we can utilize in our analysis to help us make informed decisions. Examples of metrics we aim to consider are: 

    * Average Difficulty Level: By looking at the feedback acquired we can conclude the difficulty level of the current iteration of the game. This metric proves useful as it informs us on whether we need to make adequate changes to the difficulty of the game so that it becomes more enjoyable for the target audience 
    * Average Survival Time: The average survival time acts as a similar metric to the Average Difficulty Level as it indicates whether a level in our game is currently too easy to complete or whether players are really struggling
    * Player retention: Player retention is an important metric to consider as it indicates whether players find our game engaging as the goal is to create a game that players find enjoyable. A low score on this metric would prompt us to perform a very detailed review of the feedback acquired from the participants of the evaluation specifically sections such as What the participant finds frustrating. 
    * Ability Usage Rate: As the abilities are one of the core mechanics of our game we want to ensure they are being well used and we want to avoid one ability being used more than another as this limits our gameplay. As such when using this metric if it reveals that one ability is being used more than another or an ability is not being utilized at all, it makes us aware that we have to make changes to the ability. 


### Timeline ### 

* Evaluation will be performed around Week 12 once we have a more polished version of the game so that our focus after the evaluation is on how to improve it. 
* Changes to the game will be made over SWOTVAC and the week after to ensure we have adequate time to make changes in the event there are significant changes that need to be made. 

### Responsibilities ###

* It is ideal that the responsibilities are equally divided among group members as it increases the likelihood of conducting a high-quality evaluation. Tasks such as recruiting participants are ideal to be divided among all the group members as having more participants ensures that we are able to receive ample feedback. Similarly creating the questionnaire and the questions to be asked during the evaluation should be the task of all members as it ensures that we are covering a wide range of areas of possible feedback. It will be the expectation that each member also contributes to analyzing the results, writing up the report, and developing any required changes as it ensures that the process will be completed in a timely manner. To ensure accountability we will have progress checks or milestones in place to ensure that group members are completing tasks on schedule. Communication and updates will also be an expectation of members as it ensures that the evaluation process is being carried out efficiently
