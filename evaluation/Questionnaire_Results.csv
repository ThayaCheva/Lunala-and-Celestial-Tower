the noise it makes when u cleave like a bunch of guys is really fucking loud LOL ","","yeh it felt good, the dash feels good","yah it's really easy to run around in a circle cause the time the dudes take to start swing at you is longer than ur speed of just running past them so u can kinda just strafe the guys and ranged attack them for free, and ur dash is a get out of jail free card on such a low cd so u can just stay out of range heal urself, walk past them pop ur 1 and then dash out and keep running in a circle and shooting them","is fine","2","3 minute","2","3","Lunar Lance (Right Click)","a thing that does damage when u dash would make that button very good feeling lmao","Maybe"

The layout also made it a bit confusing, I wasn't sure where I was meant to go, or what I was meant to do. It might help to give a certain task to do rather than just waiting for the gate to open. I didn't find a use for the inventory. I also found the mouse controls a bit frustrating; I only have a keypad so it felt really clunky in terms of controls for short-range attack. I'm not really versed in this genre of game though so take this with a grain of salt!","","I liked the visual aesthetic + music, going into the first level the spatial design (3d ish?) was a nice surprise. The music was cool as well. ","didn't make it that far hahaha","the mouse controls might be better suited as a key control rather than mouse/click controls.

I LOVE the sound effects. I don't think the dash should be called that, but once I got used to it it feels super satisfying. I do wonder if it's been playtested, since you can pretty easily sprint through all the enemies (even when they're in a big crowd) without them having time to attack. I think the normal walking speed might be a tiny bit fast?","Attack buttons are unclear - it looked like it was indicating left and right mouse buttons to me, but they didn't do anything.","I think so. The minor one was that the mouse buttons didn't seem to work for attacking. The major one was that, once I reached the end of the first non-tutorial room (and ran around for a bit because I wasn't sure where to go), I seemd to walk through the door and into the void. At first I thought it was just an unlit corridor or something, but I started slowly sinking and the camera kept getting close to the floor/enemies until it clipped through. Very entertaining but I doubt that was supposed to happen.","Sound effects are 11/10. I liked the little sprint dash thing. ","I did not beat the game :(","Mouse buttons didn't seem to work. Character seemed a little unwieldy at first because the walking speed it so fast, but I got used to it","3","2 minute","1","1","Did not use any ability","A better tutorial might help - rather than just a list of controls, maybe ""Try lancing this box here!"" and ""Try equipping your first upgrade now!"" kind of thing?","Yes"

Magic Cat Academy as well, because of the innovative game design and characters. Scrabble and Chess as well. ","Real Time Strategy;Shooters;RPG;Battle Royale","Story;Sound and Music","I like the colour palette and design. ","Improvement suggestions are: for the Abilities page, specify what '0/8 Unlocked' means, possibly change the font of the Abilities page to a font like Montserrat because it is quite difficult to read, make a preview page for the game aspects left to unlock for '0/8 Unlocked', increase the magnitude of the energy bar and number of tokens / points bar in the top left corner, write 'Game Over' if level not achieved, possibly edit the design of defeated Lunala character, make a simple automated example level for how to play a level of the game, basically to explain how to implement the skills learned in a level and possibly edit the name of the game because Celestial Tower is a Pokemon game feature name which may be trademarked / have copyright.","One error was, for Floor 1, when the Gate opened, I clicked > arrow so that Lunala would cross the door / gate. I forgot to click F, and then the Lunala character went to a pitch black background. When I clicked < Lunala character went back to gate but appeared invisible in the level floor and the other characters were stationary. ","Colour palette, design, factors.","1.
